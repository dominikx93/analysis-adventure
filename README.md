## Deep Neural Network from Scratch – Build and Apply 🧠📸 5 August 2025

Taking the next step in my deep learning journey, I built a fully customisable deep neural network using only Python and NumPy. This two-part project focuses on understanding both the architecture and practical application of L-layer feedforward networks — no high-level libraries involved.

### 🔧 Part 1: Building the Neural Network – Step by Step

In this notebook, I implemented the entire structure of a deep neural network from scratch. The architecture is designed to support any number of layers and is built using clean, reusable functions for all key operations.

Key Concepts Practiced:

	• ReLU and Sigmoid activation functions
	• Forward and backward propagation through multiple layers
	• Cost computation and gradient descent
	• Modular and scalable design with full vectorisation

### 🖼️ Part 2: Image Classification with Deep Neural Network

In the second notebook, I applied the deep neural network to a binary image classification task: identifying cat vs non-cat images. This involved data preprocessing, training, testing, and visualising results.

Key Concepts Practiced:

	• Image vectorisation and preprocessing
	• Multi-layer training using the custom-built architecture
	• Accuracy evaluation on training and test sets
	• Visual analysis of predictions and errors

## Planar Data Classification with One Hidden Layer 🧠 4 August 2025

Continuing my deep learning journey, I built my first two-layer neural network from scratch using just Python and NumPy. This time, the task was binary classification on a 2D planar dataset, and I implemented a full feedforward neural network with a single hidden layer.

Through this project, I gained practical experience with:

	• Non-linear activation functions like tanh
	• Forward and backward propagation
	• Computing cross-entropy loss
	• Manual gradient descent updates for all parameters

No high-level libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch were used — everything was implemented from the ground up to reinforce how deep learning works behind the scenes.

## Logistic Regression with a Neural Network Mindset 🤖 3 August 2025

As part of my deep learning journey, I built my very first model using Python and NumPy, applying logistic regression through the lens of a simple neural network. This hands-on project helped me understand the foundational building blocks of deep learning, such as forward and backward propagation, cost computation, and gradient descent.

I implemented everything from scratch — no pre-built libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch — to deepen my understanding of how neural networks actually work under the hood.

## Business Data Analysis with SAS & SQL - 2 📊 14 July 2025
For my INFS5710 course at UNSW, I analysed a real-world dataset using SAS with integrated SQL. This time I focused on analysis of market, products and customer segmentations to support business decision-making.

## AI-Powered Product Insights for Amazon 📦 14 July 2025
This project from my course INFS5705 applies machine learning to solve two real-world problems:

	• Predicting best-selling smartphones using structured sales data
	• Detecting scratched screens with unstructured image data via autoencoders

Both models support smarter retail decisions and reduce manual work.

## Business Data Analysis with SAS & SQL - 1 📊 7 July 2025
For my INFS5710 course at UNSW, I analysed a real-world dataset using SAS with integrated SQL. This project focused on transforming raw data into actionable insights to support business decision-making.

## Exploring Graduate Salaries with Python! 🎓🐍 26 April 2025
As part of my COMM5007 course at UNSW, I took on a Python project that turned into a full-scale data adventure! This time, I dived into real-world data to explore how different college majors impact graduate salaries — from starting pay to mid-career growth.

I created three visualisations to bring the insights to life:

	• Salary rankings by major at career start
	• Salary rankings by major at mid-career
	• Salary spreads and trends across different fields

What makes this project special is that it’s not just about coding — it’s about connecting data with real decisions students make for their futures.

## Exploring Python Beyond the Classroom! 🐍❤️ 13 March 2025
As part of my COMM5007 course at UNSW, I worked on a Python project that started as a simple exercise but turned into a creative experiment! It’s a heart shape generator, where the size is based on a user’s input. What makes this special is that I took the extra step to comment on every line, explaining exactly how the code works—making this a personal milestone in my coding journey. 

This isn’t just a coursework submission; it’s also a fun little game. Try changing the input and see how the heart adapts! Hope you find it interesting! 🚀
