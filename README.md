## Analysis Adventure
My adventure in Data/Business Analytics

### Exploring Python Beyond the Classroom! 🐍❤️
As part of my COMM5007 course at UNSW, I worked on a Python project that started as a simple exercise but turned into a creative experiment! It’s a heart shape generator, where the size is based on a user’s input. What makes this special is that I took the extra step to comment on every line, explaining exactly how the code works—making this a personal milestone in my coding journey. 

This isn’t just a coursework submission; it’s also a fun little game. Try changing the input and see how the heart adapts! Hope you find it interesting! 🚀
