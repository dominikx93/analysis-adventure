# Logistic Regression with a Neural Network Mindset 🤖 3 August 2025

As part of my deep learning journey, I built my very first model using Python and NumPy, applying logistic regression through the lens of a simple neural network. This hands-on project helped me understand the foundational building blocks of deep learning, such as forward and backward propagation, cost computation, and gradient descent.

I implemented everything from scratch — no pre-built libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch — to deepen my understanding of how neural networks actually work under the hood.

# Analysis Adventure
My adventure in Data/Business Analytics

## Business Data Analysis with SAS & SQL - 2 📊 14 July 2025
For my INFS5710 course at UNSW, I analysed a real-world dataset using SAS with integrated SQL. This time I focused on analysis of market, products and customer segmentations to support business decision-making.

## AI-Powered Product Insights for Amazon 📦 14 July 2025
This project from my course INFS5705 applies machine learning to solve two real-world problems:

	• Predicting best-selling smartphones using structured sales data
	• Detecting scratched screens with unstructured image data via autoencoders

Both models support smarter retail decisions and reduce manual work.

## Business Data Analysis with SAS & SQL - 1 📊 7 July 2025
For my INFS5710 course at UNSW, I analysed a real-world dataset using SAS with integrated SQL. This project focused on transforming raw data into actionable insights to support business decision-making.

## Exploring Graduate Salaries with Python! 🎓🐍 26 April 2025
As part of my COMM5007 course at UNSW, I took on a Python project that turned into a full-scale data adventure! This time, I dived into real-world data to explore how different college majors impact graduate salaries — from starting pay to mid-career growth.

I created three visualisations to bring the insights to life:

	• Salary rankings by major at career start
	• Salary rankings by major at mid-career
	• Salary spreads and trends across different fields

What makes this project special is that it’s not just about coding — it’s about connecting data with real decisions students make for their futures.

## Exploring Python Beyond the Classroom! 🐍❤️ 13 March 2025
As part of my COMM5007 course at UNSW, I worked on a Python project that started as a simple exercise but turned into a creative experiment! It’s a heart shape generator, where the size is based on a user’s input. What makes this special is that I took the extra step to comment on every line, explaining exactly how the code works—making this a personal milestone in my coding journey. 

This isn’t just a coursework submission; it’s also a fun little game. Try changing the input and see how the heart adapts! Hope you find it interesting! 🚀
