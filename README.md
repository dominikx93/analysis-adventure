# Analysis Adventure
My adventure in Data/Business Analytics

## Business Data Analysis with SAS & SQL 📊 7 July 2025
For my INFS5710 course at UNSW, I analysed a real-world dataset using SAS with integrated SQL. This project focused on transforming raw data into actionable insights to support business decision-making.

## Exploring Graduate Salaries with Python! 🎓🐍 26 April 2025
As part of my COMM5007 course at UNSW, I took on a Python project that turned into a full-scale data adventure! This time, I dived into real-world data to explore how different college majors impact graduate salaries — from starting pay to mid-career growth.

I created three visualisations to bring the insights to life:

	• Salary rankings by major at career start
 
	• Salary rankings by major at mid-career
 
	• Salary spreads and trends across different fields

What makes this project special is that it’s not just about coding — it’s about connecting data with real decisions students make for their futures.

## Exploring Python Beyond the Classroom! 🐍❤️ 13 March 2025
As part of my COMM5007 course at UNSW, I worked on a Python project that started as a simple exercise but turned into a creative experiment! It’s a heart shape generator, where the size is based on a user’s input. What makes this special is that I took the extra step to comment on every line, explaining exactly how the code works—making this a personal milestone in my coding journey. 

This isn’t just a coursework submission; it’s also a fun little game. Try changing the input and see how the heart adapts! Hope you find it interesting! 🚀
